    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>e concept of e-commerce dates back much further than most people realize, with roots in early electronic data exchange systems. The modern era of online shopping, however, truly began in the late 20th century.

It was in 1979 that British entrepreneur Michael Aldrich invented electronic shopping by connecting a modified television to a transaction-processing computer via a telephone line. This early innovation, while revolutionary, was primarily used for business-to-business transactions.

The widespread adoption of e-commerce as we know it today was catalyzed by two major events in the 1990s: the public release of the World Wide Web in 1991 and the launch of the first web browsers. These developments made it possible for anyone to browse and purchase products online. This is the era that saw the birth of e-commerce giants like Amazon and eBay in 1995, forever changing the retail landscape.

In the years since, e-commerce has evolved from a niche activity to an integral part of daily life. The rise of secure payment systems like PayPal, the proliferation of smartphones, and the development of social media have all fueled explosive growth. Today, e-commerce is a multi-trillion dollar industry, constantly innovating with new technologies like AI-powered recommendations, voice commerce, and same-day delivery..</p>
